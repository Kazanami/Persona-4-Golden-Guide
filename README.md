# Persona 4 Golden Guide
##### by Kenneth Black

A website guide for Persona 4 Golden. With 23 social links, 69 quests, and countless other things to do in Persona 4, deciding how to spend time can feel overwhelming. My aim with this guide was primarily to show the user which social links are available on any given day so they so they can plan appropriately. My intention was to be as spoiler-lite as possible, but to also include other things they might otherwise miss, such as shopping channel rewards, social link openings, and general advice. I've also included test answers under a spoiler button and social link dialog 'answers' that can help the player maximize social link points.

I initially built this app using a node.js back end with express and swig, but down the line I realized that it would run much faster as an AngularJS single page application. The fullstack JavaScript version is saved as the 'node' branch.

The data for this app is from a JSON object that I partially made myself and partially pulled from other guides. Credit for calendar info to http://persona4.wikidot.com/schedule, and social link dialog to https://sites.google.com/site/persona4goldenguide
